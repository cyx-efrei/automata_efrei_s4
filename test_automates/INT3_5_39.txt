==================== Word Recognation ====================

Do you want to recognize a word on the automate or its complementary ?
 1. This automate
 2. The complementary

 -> 1

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> ab

- A transition with the character b has been found from 12 to 21

The word ab is succefully recognize

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> abbbccdd

- A transition with the character b has been found from 12 to 21
- A transition with the character b has been found from 21 to 12
- A transition with the character b has been found from 12 to 21

No transition with the character c has not been found
Sorry, the word " abbbccdd "is not recognize by this automaton

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> abcd

- A transition with the character b has been found from 12 to 21

No transition with the character c has not been found
Sorry, the word " abcd "is not recognize by this automaton

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> abba

- A transition with the character b has been found from 12 to 21
- A transition with the character b has been found from 21 to 12
- A transition with the character a has been found from 12 to 10

The word abba is succefully recognize

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> end

The first character e has not been found
Sorry, the word " end "is not recognize by this automaton
