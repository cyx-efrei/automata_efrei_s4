Is your automaton complete ?
 -> NO !


Next step : Explanation !

======= EXPLANATION

This automaton is not complete because :

The state 0 doesn't have :
-    Transition of b

The state 269 doesn't have :
-    Transition of a

The state 37 doesn't have :
-    Transition of b

The state 69 doesn't have :
-    Transition of a

The state 7 doesn't have :
-    Transition of b
