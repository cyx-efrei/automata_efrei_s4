======= EXPLANATION

This automaton is not complete because : 

The state 0 doesn't have : 
-    Transition of b

The state 269 doesn't have : 
-    Transition of a

The state 37 doesn't have : 
-    Transition of b

The state 69 doesn't have : 
-    Transition of a

The state 7 doesn't have : 
-    Transition of b

==================== Word Recognation ====================

Do you want to recognize a word on the automate or its complementary ?
 1. This automate
 2. The complementary

 -> 1

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> ababa

- A transition with the character b has been found from 269 to 37
- A transition with the character a has been found from 37 to 69
- A transition with the character b has been found from 69 to 7
- A transition with the character a has been found from 7 to 69

The word ababa is succefully recognize

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> aaa


No transition with the character a has not been found
Sorry, the word " aaa "is not recognize by this automaton

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> end

The first character e has not been found
Sorry, the word " end "is not recognize by this automaton
