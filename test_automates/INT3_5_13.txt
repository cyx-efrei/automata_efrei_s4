==================== Word Recognation ====================


Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> aaaaaaaaaaaaa

- A transition with the character a has been found from 2 to 3
- A transition with the character a has been found from 3 to 4
- A transition with the character a has been found from 4 to 5
- A transition with the character a has been found from 5 to 6
- A transition with the character a has been found from 6 to 7
- A transition with the character a has been found from 7 to 0
- A transition with the character a has been found from 0 to 0
- A transition with the character a has been found from 0 to 0
- A transition with the character a has been found from 0 to 0
- A transition with the character a has been found from 0 to 0
- A transition with the character a has been found from 0 to 0
- A transition with the character a has been found from 0 to 0

The word aaaaaaaaaaaaa is succefully recognize

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> ab


No transition with the character b has not been found
Sorry, the word " ab "is not recognize by this automaton

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> end

The first character e has not been found
Sorry, the word " end "is not recognize by this automaton
