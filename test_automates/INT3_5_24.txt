==================== COMPLETION PART ====================

Is your automaton complete ?
 -> NO !


Next step : Explanation !
Click on anything to continue



======= EXPLANATION

This automaton is not complete because :

The state 0 doesn't have :
-    Transition of a
-    Transition of b
-    Transition of c

The state 3 doesn't have :
-    Transition of a

The state 4 doesn't have :
-    Transition of a
-    Transition of b

==================== Word Recognation ====================


Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> abcd

- A transition with the character b has been found from 2 to 3
- A transition with the character c has been found from 3 to 4
- A transition with the character d has been found from 4 to 0

The word abcd is succefully recognize

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> aad

- A transition with the character a has been found from 2 to 2
- A transition with the character d has been found from 2 to 0

The word aad is succefully recognize

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> end

The first character e has not been found
Sorry, the word " end "is not recognize by this automaton
