==================== DETERMINISTIC ====================

     - There is your default automaton : 


+------+--------+--------------+--------------+
|      | STATES | Transition a | Transition b |
+------+--------+--------------+--------------+
| <--> |   0    |      1       |     ---      |

+------+--------+--------------+--------------+

Is your automaton determinized ? 
 -> yes !


Next step : Completion !
Click on anything to continue


==================== COMPLETION PART ====================

Is your automaton complete ? 
 -> NO !


Next step : Explanation !
Click on anything to continue



======= EXPLANATION

This automaton is not complete because : 

The state 0 doesn't have : 
-    Transition of b

The state 2 doesn't have : 
-    Transition of b

The state 4 doesn't have : 
-    Transition of b

Next step : Completion !

==================== STANDARDIZATION ====================


Is your automaton standardize ? 
 -> NO !


Explanation : There is a transition to the initial state so the automaton is not standard !

Next step : Standardization !

==================== Word Recognation ====================


Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> aaaaaaaaaaaa

- A transition with the character a has been found from 1 to 2
- A transition with the character a has been found from 2 to 3
- A transition with the character a has been found from 3 to 4
- A transition with the character a has been found from 4 to 0
- A transition with the character a has been found from 0 to 1
- A transition with the character a has been found from 1 to 2
- A transition with the character a has been found from 2 to 3
- A transition with the character a has been found from 3 to 4
- A transition with the character a has been found from 4 to 0
- A transition with the character a has been found from 0 to 1
- A transition with the character a has been found from 1 to 2

The last state to complete the word " aaaaaaaaaaaa " isn't a terminal so it's not recognize ! (Last state : 2)

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> aaaaa

- A transition with the character a has been found from 1 to 2
- A transition with the character a has been found from 2 to 3
- A transition with the character a has been found from 3 to 4
- A transition with the character a has been found from 4 to 0

The word aaaaa is succefully recognize

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> end

The first character e has not been found
Sorry, the word " end "is not recognize by this automaton
