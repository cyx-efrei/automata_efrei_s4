The state 12 doesn't have : 
-    Transition of c
-    Transition of d

-    Transition of a
-    Transition of d

The state 34 doesn't have : 
-    Transition of a
-    Transition of b

==================== Word Recognation ====================

Do you want to recognize a word on the automate or its complementary ?
 1. This automate
 2. The complementary

 -> 1

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> abcd

- A transition with the character b has been found from 12 to 23
- A transition with the character c has been found from 23 to 34
- A transition with the character d has been found from 34 to 40

The word abcd is succefully recognize

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> aaaa

- A transition with the character a has been found from 12 to 12
- A transition with the character a has been found from 12 to 12
- A transition with the character a has been found from 12 to 12

The last state to complete the word " aaaa " isn't a terminal so it's not recognize ! (Last state : 12)

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> end

The first character e has not been found
Sorry, the word " end "is not recognize by this automaton
