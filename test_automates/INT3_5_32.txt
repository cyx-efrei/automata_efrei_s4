Do you want to recognize a word on the automate or its complementary ?
 1. This automate
 2. The complementary

 -> 1

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> abc


No transition with the character b has not been found
Sorry, the word " abc "is not recognize by this automaton

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> aa


No transition with the character a has not been found
Sorry, the word " aa "is not recognize by this automaton

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> a


The last state to complete the word " a " isn't a terminal so it's not recognize ! (Last state : 7)

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> bc

- A transition with the character c has been found from 4 to 9

The word bc is succefully recognize

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
