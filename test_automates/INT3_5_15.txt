==================== Word Recognation ====================


Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> accdd

- A transition with the character c has been found from 1 to 3
- A transition with the character c has been found from 3 to 3
- A transition with the character d has been found from 3 to 4
- A transition with the character d has been found from 4 to 4

The word accdd is succefully recognize

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> abdddcdd

- A transition with the character b has been found from 1 to 2
- A transition with the character d has been found from 2 to 4
- A transition with the character d has been found from 4 to 4
- A transition with the character d has been found from 4 to 4
- A transition with the character c has been found from 4 to 0
- A transition with the character d has been found from 0 to P
- A transition with the character d has been found from P to P

The last state to complete the word " abdddcdd " isn't a terminal so it's not recognize ! (Last state : P)

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> end

The first character e has not been found
Sorry, the word " end "is not recognize by this automaton
