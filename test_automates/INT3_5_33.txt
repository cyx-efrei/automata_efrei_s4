======= EXPLANATION

This automaton is not complete because : 

The state 38 doesn't have : 
-    Transition of b

The state 6 doesn't have : 
-    Transition of a
-    Transition of b
-    Transition of c

The state 8 doesn't have : 
-    Transition of b
-    Transition of c

 2. The complementary

 -> 1

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :

- A transition with the character c has been found from 38 to 6

The word ac is succefully recognize

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> acb

- A transition with the character c has been found from 38 to 6

No transition with the character b has not been found
Sorry, the word " acb "is not recognize by this automaton

Enter "end" to stop the loop.
Enter the word to recognize :
 -> end
